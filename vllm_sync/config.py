@dataclass
class ScriptArguments:
    r"""
    Arguments for the script.

    Args:
        model (`str`):
            Model name or path to load the model from.
        revision (`str`, *optional*):
            Revision to use for the model. If not specified, the default branch will be used.
        tensor_parallel_size (`int`, *optional*, defaults to `1`):
            Number of tensor parallel workers to use.
        data_parallel_size (`int`, *optional*, defaults to `1`):
            Number of data parallel workers to use.
        host (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `"0.0.0.0"`):
            Host address to run the server on.
        port (`int`, *optional*, defaults to `8000`):
            Port to run the server on.
        gpu_memory_utilization (`float`, *optional*, defaults to `0.9`):
            Ratio (between 0 and 1) of GPU memory to reserve for the model weights, activations, and KV cache on the
            device dedicated to generation powered by vLLM. Higher values will increase the KV cache size and thus
            improve the model's throughput. However, if the value is too high, it may cause out-of-memory (OOM) errors
            during initialization.
        dtype (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `"auto"`):
            Data type to use for vLLM generation. If set to `"auto"`, the data type will be automatically determined
            based on the model configuration. Find the supported values in the vLLM documentation.
        max_model_len (`int`, *optional*):
            If set, the `max_model_len` to use for vLLM. This can be useful when running with reduced
            `vllm_gpu_memory_utilization`, leading to a reduced KV cache size. If not set, vLLM will use the model
            context size, which might be much larger than the KV cache, leading to inefficiencies.
        enable_prefix_caching (`bool`, *optional*):
            Whether to enable prefix caching in vLLM. If set to `True`, ensure that the model and the hardware support
            this feature.
        enforce_eager (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`):
            Whether to enforce eager execution. If set to `True`, we will disable CUDA graph and always execute the
            model in eager mode. If `False` (default behavior), we will use CUDA graph and eager execution in hybrid.
        vllm_model_impl (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `"vllm"`):
            Model implementation to use for vLLM. Must be one of `"transformers"` or `"vllm"`. `"transformers"`: Use
            the `transformers` backend for model implementation. `"vllm"`: Use the `vllm` library for model
            implementation.
        kv_cache_dtype (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `"auto"`):
            Data type to use for KV cache. If set to `"auto"`, the dtype will default to the model data type.
        trust_remote_code (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`):
            Whether to trust remote code when loading models. Set to `True` to allow executing code from model
            repositories. This is required for some custom models but introduces security risks.
        log_level (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `"info"`):
            Log level for uvicorn. Possible choices: `"critical"`, `"error"`, `"warning"`, `"info"`, `"debug"`,
            `"trace"`.
